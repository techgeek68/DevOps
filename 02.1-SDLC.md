# Software Development Life Cycle

**What is SDLC?**

A systematic framework for planning, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. It ensures the final product meets user requirements and is free of defects.

**Structured Process:**

→ Like following a recipe to bake a cake (ingredients = code, steps = phases).


**Quality Assurance:**

→ Ensures the software works as intended (e.g., a banking app must handle transactions securely.

```
Example:
- Imagine building an e-commerce app:

- Requirement:
 - The app should let people search for products, add them to a cart, and pay for them.
  
- Design:
 - Sketch out how the app will look (UI) and plan how the product data will be stored (Database).
  
- Coding:
 - Write the backend (using Python and Django) to handle things like products and orders. Use React to build the user interface.
  
- Testing:
 - Make sure the payment system (like Coonect IPS, eSewa, or Khalti) works properly by testing different cases.
  
- Deployment:
 - Put the app online using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or a locally managed server.
  
- Maintenance:
 - Fix problems, like when items in the cart disappear after logging out, and keep the app updated.
```

**Why SDLC?**

1. Helps with planning, scheduling, and estimating
    ◦ Breaks the project into phases with timelines
   
```
◦ Example:
- A team building a Hospital Management System might allocate two weeks for requirement gathering, Four weeks for design, etc.
```
   
3. Defines standard steps for everyone to follow
    ◦ Everyone knows what to do next and how to do it.
   
```
◦ Example:
 - All developers use Git to manage code versions and updates.
```
   
5. Tracks progress and keeps things under control
    ◦ Can be checked if the project is on time or falling behind.
   
```
◦ Example:
- A project manager checks if the login feature is finished before starting payment integration.
```
   
6. Makes the plan clear to everyone involved
    ◦ Everyone - Clients, developers, testers – knows the progress.
   
```
◦ Example:
 - Stakeholders of a banking app see updates after each completed phase.
```
   
8. Speeds up development
    ◦ Clear steps mean less confusion and faster work
   
```
◦ Example:
 - A food delivery app finishes faster because everyone follows the same steps.
```

9. Improves client communication and trust
    ◦ Clients see progress regularly and can give feedback.
   
```
◦ Example:
- Showing a prototype of a food delivery app to the client every two weeks.
```

10. Reduces risks and avoids problems later
    ◦ Early testing catches critical bugs
    
```
◦ Example:
- A flight booking system is tested for high traffic to avoid crashes when People book tickets.
```

**SDLC Phases**

**Phase 1: Requirement Collection**

- Responsible teams:
    - Product Manager
    - Business Analysts
- Understand/Gather what users need/want.
  
```
- Example:
    For a fitness app, requirements may include tracking steps, heart rate, and syncing with wearable devices.
```

- Tools: Jira (for tracking tasks and user stories), Confluence (for documentation requirements, meeting notes, and product decisions)

**Phase 2: Feasibility Study**

- Check if the project is viable.

```
- Example:
    Can a startup build a smart home app? Factors: Cost (NPR 1M+), legal regulations, and technical expertise.
```

**Phase 3: Design**
- Responsible team:
    - System architects
    - UI/UX Designers
      
- Create blueprints for how the system will work and look.
  
```
- Example:
◦ Designing a ride-sharing app:

    ▪ Architecture: Microservices Architecture, with separate services like User Service, Payment Service, Ride Matching Service, etc.

    ▪ UI/UX: Mockups or wireframes for core user flows – booking a ride, viewing driver location, and tracking ride progress.

```


**Phase 4: Coding**

- Responsible team:
    - Developers (Backend & Frontend)
    
- Translate designs and requirements into working software by writing code.

```
- Example:
    ◦ Backend: Python (e.g., using Flask or Django) to create RESTful APIs

    ◦ Frontend: React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface

    ◦ Database: SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for database and retrieval
```

**Phase 5: Testing**

- Responsible team:
    - QA
    - Testers

- Ensure the software works correctly, reliably, and meets user expectations.
  
- Types:
  
    - Unit Testing: Check individual components or functions in isolation.
    - Integration Testing: Test how different modules work together.
    - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Real users test the application to confirm it meets their needs
  
```
 - Example:
    Verifying a login function returns correct results for valid/invalid credentials.

- Example:
    Ensuring the payment gateway processes transactions from the shopping cart correctly.

- Example:
    Beta testing a game app before public release.
```

- **Tools** :
◦ Selenium:
    Automates browser-based tests for web apps.

◦ Postman:
    Used to test APIs by sending HTTP requests and verifying responses.

**Phase 6: Deployment**

- Responsible team:
    - System Administrators
    - DevOps engineers

- Release the application to a production environment where users can access it.

```
- Example:
    ◦ Deploying a weather app to the App Store/Google Play with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate build, test, and release processes.
```

**Phase 7: Maintenance**

- Responsible team:
    - Support engineers
    - Maintenance team
      
- Keep the software up-to-date, reliable, and aligned with user needs over time.
  
- Types:
  
    - Corrective: Fix bugs or defects.
    - Adaptive: Modify software to work with changes in the environment.
    - Perfective: Improve performance or enhance features.
  
```
- Example: Resolving an app crash issue on iOS 15

- Example: Updating compatibility for Android 14

- Example: Adding dark mode based on user feedback

```

**Traditional SDLC Models**

**I. Waterfall Model:**
 - A simple, linear, and sequential development process
 - Follows a top-down approach
 - Each phase must be fully completed before moving to the next
 - Begins with long planning and design phases
 - After development, the software is tested and then deployed
 - Each phase is reviewed upon completion to check progress and feasibility
 - Too rigid to adapt to changes, one development starts
 - Does not support feedback or changes during the process
 - This inflexibility led to the rise of more adaptive models like Agile

```
Example: Waterfall Model – E-commerce Website

1. Requirements Gathering & Analysis

- Teams:
    - Business Analysts + Product Owners + Stakeholders

- Activities:
    - Conduct user interviews (e.g., what filters shoppers need).
    - Benchmark competitors (e.g, Daraz, local retailers).

- Produce a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) covering:
       - User registration/login
       - Product catalog and filtering
       - Shopping cart and checkout
       - Payment methods (cards, wallets)
       - Order history and tracking

- Finalize scope and sign off

- Timeline: 3 weeks

- Deliverables:
    - Approved SRS
    - Project plan
    - stakeholder sign-off

2. System & UI Design

-Teams: System Architects + UI/UX Designers + Database Designers

-Activities:
- Define architecture:
    n-tier web architecture, tech stack (e.g., React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL).

- Design an Entity Relationship(ER) diagram for products, users, orders, and payments.

- Create wireframes
    Basic sketches or layouts of a web/app and high-fidelity mockups (detailed design of pages, e.g., adding colours, logos, images) for   key pages.

- Specify non-functional requirements:
    scalability (e.g., auto-scaling), security (PCI DSS compliance), and performance (page load ≤ 2 seconds).

>Note: PCI DSS- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

- Timeline: 4 weeks

- Deliverables:
    - Architectural design document
    - Database schema
    - UI mockups + style guide
    - API specification

3. Implementation (Coding)

-Teams: Frontend Engineers + Backend Engineers + API Developers

- Activities:
    - Set up code repositories, CI pipelines.
    - Frontend:
                Build components (product grid, filter sidebar, cart modal).
    - Backend:
                Implement REST APIs (products, cart, orders, payments).
    - Integrate payment gateway.
    - Write unit tests (aiming for ≥ 70 % coverage).

- Timeline: 10 weeks

- Deliverables:
    - Functioning codebase in dev environment
    - Unit-test reports
    - Continuous integration build passing

4. Integration & System Testing

- Teams: QA Engineers + Test Automation Engineers

- Activities:
    - Develop test plans and test cases (functional, regression, security).
    - Execute manual tests (e.g., checkout flow, edge cases like out-of-stock).
    - Run automated suites (e.g., Selenium for UI flows, Postman for APIs).
    - Log defects; developers fix bugs in a separate “bugfix” cycle.
    - Perform load testing (e.g, simulate 1,000 concurrent users).

- Timeline: 4 weeks

- Deliverables:
    - Test reports (bug counts, severity)
    - Signed-off release candidate build

5. Deployment & Maintenance
- Teams: DevOps Engineers + System Administrators + Support Engineers

- Activities:
    - Provision production environment (IaC with Terraform).
    - Configure CI/CD pipeline to deploy to staging, then production.
    - Conduct smoke tests post-deploy.
    - Provide user documentation and train support staff.
    - Monitor live metrics (uptime, response times) and resolve incidents (SLAs: 1 hr for critical).

- Timeline:
    - Deployment: 1 week
    - Maintenance: ongoing

- Deliverables:
    - Live site
    - runbooks
    - support logs

Feedback & Change Control:

- When: At phase-gate reviews (end of each phase) or post-launch

- How: Formal Change Request (CCR) process; each request is impact-assessed (time, cost)

- Effect: Late changes (e.g., “add wishlist”) go to future maintenance release (costly to retrofit)


Challenges:

- Inflexibility: Hard to pivot if market or requirements change mid-project

- Risk of Late Discovery: Usability issues or missing features only surface at Testing or after launch

- High Rework Cost: Even minor scope changes can require revisiting multiple phases

```


**II. Agile Model:**
- Focuses on iterative and incremental development
- The application is initially released with high-priority features in the first iteration
- After release, end-user/customer feedback is collected
- Feedback is used to make improvements and add new features. The updated application will be released in the next iteration
- This cycle repeats until the desired software quality is achieved
- Encourages continuous interaction between development and testing teams
- The entire project is broken into small, manageable builds
- Each build is delivered in iterations, typically lasting 1 to 3 weeks

```
Example: Agile Model – E-commerce Website

1. Initial Backlog & Architecture Spike (Sprint 0)

- Teams: Cross-functional Scrum Team (Developers, QA, DevOps, UX) + Product Owner + Scrum Master

- Activities:
 - Product Owner writes user stories (e.g., “As a shopper, I want to filter products by size so I can find items that fit”).
 - Team estimates stories (story points) and sets up basic architecture (CI/CD, dev/test environments).
 - Create a minimal “Definition of Done” and quality checklist.

-Timeline: 2 weeks
    - Deliverables: Initial product backlog, architecture skeleton, environments ready

2. Sprint Cycle (2-Week Iterations)

 -Sprint Planning (4 hrs):
  - Team selects highest-priority stories (e.g., login & product listing).
  - Breaks stories into tasks (frontend, backend, test tasks).

- Development & Testing (10 business days):
  - Pair programming & test-driven development.
  - Continuous integration runs on every push; immediate feedback on build/test status.

- Daily Stand-up (15 min): Synchronize progress and remove blockers.

- Sprint Review (2 hrs):
  - Demo working increment to stakeholders (e.g., live product grid with pagination).
  - Collect feedback (e.g, request “infinite scroll” instead of pagination).

- Sprint Retrospective (1 hr):
  - Discuss what went well (CI speed, collaboration) and what to improve (estimation accuracy).
  - Agree on one or two process improvements for the next sprint.


3. Example Sprint Breakdown (First 3 Sprints)

Sprint  The Core Stories Delivered                                 Key Feedback & Updates

1.       User login/logout, basic product catalog.                    “Add social login (Google/Facebook)” → backlog
                                  

2.       Shopping cart add/remove, product search + filtering.         “Enable coupon codes at checkout” → backlog
                             

3.       Checkout flow, integration with Stripe, and order history.     UI tweak: show order confirmation email link
           


4. Continuous Delivery & Adaptation
    - At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product Increment is ready for real-user testing (Feature toggled off until fully polished.)

    - New high-value stories (e.g., “Wishlist,” “Live Chat Support”) can be added anytime to the product backlog and prioritized for the   next sprint.

5. Deployment & Operations
    - Small, frequent releases (canary deploys) after every 2–3 sprints.
    - DevOps monitors metrics and rolls back immediately on critical issues.
    - Support team triages user tickets; high-priority fixes go into the sprint backlog.

Feedback & Change Handling
- When: After every Sprint Review (every 2 weeks)
- How: Stakeholder feedback is directly fed into the backlog; no formal Change the board needed
- Effect: High-priority changes can appear in the next sprint, keeping the product aligned with evolving needs

Benefits & Challenges
- Benefits:
  - Rapid value delivery (first basic shopping in 2 weeks).
  - High adaptability to new market demands (e.g., seasonal promotions).
  - Early detection of usability issues.


- Challenges:
  - Requires strong team discipline to avoid scope creep.
  - Demands continuous stakeholder engagement.
  - Needs robust automation (CI/CD, test suites) to maintain quality.
```

**Which to Choose?**

- **Waterfall** if your requirements are stable, budget/funding is fixed, and you need heavy documentation (e.g., compliance projects).
  
- **Agile** if you expect changing requirements, need fast time-to-market, and can engage stakeholders continuously.
